:D :D :D
1. I went into riddle branch, merged master into riddle branch. 
2. Solved the conflict by keeping your main_scene (I made prefabs out of the main_scene in master which you get in the merge anyways)
3. Tried to figure out what has been added to scene in the riddle branch Please add whatever I might have missed :)
4. Made prefabs out of the stuff I found new, that I put into this folder.
5. Replaced the GameContainer in main_scene with the newest one from Master.
6. Added the prefabs I made with the stuff you did in the main_scene from riddle branch into the main_scene from master (in V3/GameContainer).
7. took a sip of water.
8. connected the canvas and presentholder stuff from presents to the appriopiate places.
9. STILL CANT MOVE :(
10. took another sip of water.
11. Discover that for some reason the "Level" layer tag (and few others?) is missing in this branch.
12. Added the Level tag and put it on the Snow "mesh212" in "Terrain"
13. Everything works I think :D :D :D

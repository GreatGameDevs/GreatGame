## Importing External Assets to project
* Add all imported assets (from asset store etc.) to IgnoredAssets, these will be ignored when we push. 
* Any asset you want to be part of the project you can drag out from IgnoredAssets into the appropriate place in the project file hierarchy. Make sure they do not link to anything in IgnoredAssets folder.
